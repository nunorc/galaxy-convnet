# Galaxy ConvNet

An exploratory definition of convolutional network for automatic classification
of galaxies, based on visual images. Relevant files in the repository:

* `galaxy-convnet-v2.ipynb`: Python notebook for training the model;
* `galaxy-convnet-v2.h5`: model weights stored in HDF5 format;
* `galaxy-convnet-dataset.ipynb`: Python notebook for creating the dataset;
* `data.tgz`: possible dataset for training and validation, created with the above notebook.
